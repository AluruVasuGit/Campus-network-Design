# Campus-network-Design
Project Overview
This project focuses on designing a secure, scalable, and efficient campus network for RK Valley using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal is to provide seamless connectivity, high performance, and security across various buildings, including academic blocks, the library, and administrative offices.

Features & Implementations
Network Segmentation – VLANs & Inter-VLAN Routing for better traffic management.
Dynamic IP Allocation – DHCP Server for automatic IP assignment.
Domain Name Resolution – DNS Server for efficient name resolution.
Routing Protocols – OSPF & RIP for optimized data transfer.
Remote Management – SSH & Telnet for secure administrative access.
Security Measures – Firewalls & ACLs to prevent unauthorized access.

Tools & Technologies Used
Cisco Packet Tracer – Network simulation and design.
Routing & Switching Protocols – OSPF, RIP, VLANs, ACLs.
Network Services – DHCP, DNS, Web Server.
Security Implementations – Firewalls, SSH, Telnet.
Project Outcomes
✔ Reliable and high-speed connectivity across all campus buildings.
✔ Improved security through VLAN segmentation and access control.
✔ Scalability – Easily expandable for future enhancements.
✔ Remote Network Management via SSH & Telnet.
